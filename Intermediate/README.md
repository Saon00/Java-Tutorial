- ArrayList
    - It is in Jdk since 1.2
    - Not Syncronised
    - If you don't need to syncronise any code. Just simply use this.
- Vector
    - It is in Jdk since 1.0
    - Syncronised
    - [Thead Safe] - It means it's ok to use it from different threads without we having to syncronise the code
    - If you need to syncronise any code. Just simply use this. But it makes code slow

`Vector and Arraylist's methods are almost same. So I don't upload any Vector's examples.`

- [Singly Linked Lists]
    - time complexity O(1) `Because it don't depends how many items in the list. As long you inserting/removing at the front of the list.`
    - Only have a refference to the head of the list
